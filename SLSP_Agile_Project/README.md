# SLSP Agile Customization Project
In this folder you find code that resulted from the SLSP Agile Customization Project. It is possible to paste the code directly into the custom.js file of the primo customization package.

## edit-personal-info-buttons.js
This code adds to buttons to the personal details page of the user account in Primo to edit personal information in the SWITCH-Edu-ID account and to add/change library card numbers. If the user is connected with an alma account the buttons are replaced by corresponding information (contact your library etc.).
